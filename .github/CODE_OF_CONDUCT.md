# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and
our community a welcoming, safe, and equitable experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics,
gender identity and expression, level of experience, education,
socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion,
or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

- Respecting the purpose and activities of the community
- Engaging with other community members with kindness, honesty, and good faith
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
- Being conscious of the impacts of our actions on other community members
  and the larger public, and committing to repairing harm when it occurs
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment. Violating explicitly expressed boundaries or engaging in
  unnecessary personal attention after any clear request to stop
- Character attacks. Making demeaning, discriminatory, or disparaging remarks,
  particularly against members of vulnerable or marginalized groups
- Stereotyping. Identifying someone or defining their experience based solely
  on assumed characteristics of groups they belong to
- Inappropriate sexualization. Using sexualized language or imagery, or making
  sexual advances of any kind
- Violating confidentiality. Publishing others' private information without
  their explicit permission
- Endangerment. Causing, encouraging, or threatening violence or other harm
  to individuals or groups
- Impersonation. Misleading others about identity or the origin of messages
- Failure to credit. Not acknowledging the sources of information or ideas
  used in one's own work
- Spam. Distributing promotional materials outside community norms
- Irresponsible communication. Publicizing or sensationalizing sensitive
  reports of restricted behaviors, or otherwise acting in a way that
  undermines an ongoing investigation

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards
of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action
in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening,
offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for
moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies
when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an
appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by sending an email to `opensource@frenck.dev`.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.
