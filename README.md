GitHub Actions Workflows for the Home Assistant Community Add-ons

## About

This repository contains GitHub Actions Workflows that are shared across
the other Home Assistant Community Add-ons repositories.

It allows us to maintain all our workflows in a single place and reuse
them across the Home Assistant Community Add-ons organization.

While these workflows are public, they are subjected to change and not
versioned in terms of releases. Using them from this repository directly for
other project is possible, but not recommended for that reason.

## Changelog & Releases

Unlike all other projects provided by the Home Assistant Community Add-ons
project, this repository isn't versioned (in terms of releases).

If you want to see what has changed, please see the commit history of the
main branch: <https://github.com/hassio-addons/workflows/commits/main>
